# Part one: introduction

## Why model?

  * Everyone models.
  
  * Model system (zebrafish / mouse / organoids).
  
  * I just happen to use the language of maths/computers rather than
    verbal arguments.

## What can we do with modelling


* Quantitative modelling: test that theories hold true, or test their
  limits.

* Qualitative modelling: make abstract models to capture essence of a
  system.  (cf. epidemiological modelling since 2020).

* Experiments test for *necessity*; models test for *sufficiency*.
  
* Make predictions  about novel situations.

* Made postdictions to explain past data sets (Abbott 2008).

# Part two: Physiological models

We start with classic Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) model.

## Mathematical description of ion channels

Voltage-gated channels: gating variables [0,1] to represent flow of ions.

For given voltage, e.g. K channel activation, gated by $n$:


(1-n) Gates switch from closed state to open state with rate $\alpha$.

(n) Gates switch from open state to closed state with rate $\beta$.

i.e. 
	$$ \frac{dn}{dt} = \alpha(1-n) - \beta n $$

The terms $\alpha$ and $\beta$ themselves depend on membrane voltage


Similar expressions can be created for sodium activiation (m) and
inactivation (h).

---
## Ionic flow determines membrane voltage.


We can derive an expression:

$$c_m \frac{dV}{dt} = -g_L (E_L - V) - g_{Na} m^3 h (E_{Na} - V) - g_K n^4(E_K - V) + I_e$$
	
where the $g$ terms are the maximal conductances for each channel, and
the $E$ terms are the resting potentials for each channel.

This leads to four coupled differential equations.  

Solving these requires methods of *numerical integration*.

## Demonstration


Live demo of all-or-nothing behaviour: 

<https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/HodgkinHuxleyActionPotentialModel/>

As you vary external stimulus you can see emergence of an action
potential.

## Goodness of fit

Hodgkin and Huxley(1952).  Reproduced from David Sterratt.  Upper
trace: model; numbers give initial depolarisations (in mV);
recordings at 6~C.


Data taken from squid giant axon; much wider axonal diameter (800
um) than normal (2 um) for rapid signal propagation [escape behaviour].

## Simplifications to H-H framework

  Two observations (Rinzel, 1985):
  
  `r im1("ch5fig10.png", 500)`
  `r pbr("Dayan and Abbott (2002) fig 5.10.")`
  
1. $m$ reaches steady-state almost instantaneously.
  
2. $h$ and $1-n$ have similar voltage dependence, so model just one of
   them.

## Rinzel simplification vs HH model

Wilson (1999) Fig 9.3.  Comparison of HH model with Rinzel
approximation (eqn 9.7).  Both systems produce a reduced spike
amplitude at higher frequencies.

## What is the 'right model' to use?

  Various simplifications to Hodgkin-Huxley (Izhikevich, 2004; Figure 2):

## What is the Izhikevich (2003) model?

## Application of Izhikevich model neurons 

We can now build model circuits using these neurons.  e.g. Tomkova et
al 2015: <https://paperpile.com/app/p/5529195b-9246-0d04-8449-09b3cc7289db>


---
## Dynamic clamp

  Dynamic clamp takes membrane voltage, and simulates current that
  will pass through a particular channel; that channel is injected
  real-time, as if that channel existed on the neuron.

  This allows us to use biology to worry about all the other
  conductances, rather than a modeller using poor estimates of the
  conductances.


---
## Dynamic clamp application 


  Can two mutually inhibitory neurons fire in synchrony?
  
  Use dynamic clamp to *virtually* connect two neurons.
