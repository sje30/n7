# Part one: introduction

---
## Why model?

  * Everyone models.

  * Model system (zebrafish / mouse / organoids).

  * I just happen to use the language of maths/computers rather than
    verbal arguments.

## What can we do with modelling


* Quantitative modelling: test that theories hold true, or test their
  limits.

* Qualitative modelling: make abstract models to capture essence of a
  system.  (cf. epidemiological modelling since 2020).

* Experiments test for *necessity*; models test for *sufficiency*.

* Make predictions  about novel situations.

* Made postdictions to explain past data sets (Abbott 2008).

# Part two: Physiological models

We start with classic Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) model.

## Mathematical description of ion channels

Voltage-gated channels: gating variables [0,1] to represent flow of ions.

For given voltage, e.g. K channel activation, gated by $n$:


(1-n) Gates switch from closed state to open state with rate $\alpha$.

(n) Gates switch from open state to closed state with rate $\beta$.

i.e.
	$$ \frac{dn}{dt} = \alpha(1-n) - \beta n $$

The terms $\alpha$ and $\beta$ themselves depend on membrane voltage


Similar expressions can be created for sodium activiation (m) and
inactivation (h).

---
## Ionic flow determines membrane voltage.


We can derive an expression:

$$c_m \frac{dV}{dt} = -g_L (E_L - V) - g_{Na} m^3 h (E_{Na} - V) - g_K n^4(E_K - V) + I_e$$
	
where the $g$ terms are the maximal conductances for each channel, and
the $E$ terms are the resting potentials for each channel.

This leads to four coupled differential equations.

Solving these requires methods of *numerical integration*.

## Demonstration


Live demo of all-or-nothing behaviour:

As you vary external stimulus you can see emergence of an action
potential.

## Goodness of fit

Hodgkin and Huxley(1952).  Reproduced from David Sterratt.  Upper
trace: model; numbers give initial depolarisations (in mV);
recordings at 6~C.


Data taken from squid giant axon; much wider axonal diameter (800
um) than normal (2 um) for rapid signal propagation [escape behaviour].

## Simplifications to H-H framework

  Two observations (Rinzel, 1985):

  `r im1("ch5fig10.png", 500)`
  `r pbr("Dayan and Abbott (2002) fig 5.10.")`

1. $m$ reaches steady-state almost instantaneously.

2. $h$ and $1-n$ have similar voltage dependence, so model just one of
   them.

## Rinzel simplification vs HH model

Wilson (1999) Fig 9.3.  Comparison of HH model with Rinzel
approximation (eqn 9.7).  Both systems produce a reduced spike
amplitude at higher frequencies.

## What is the 'right model' to use?

  Various simplifications to Hodgkin-Huxley (Izhikevich, 2004; Figure 2):

## What is the Izhikevich (2003) model?


`r im1("izhik.png", 800)`

---
## Application of Izhikevich model neurons

We can now build model circuits using these neurons.  e.g. Tomkova et
al 2015: <https://paperpile.com/app/p/5529195b-9246-0d04-8449-09b3cc7289db>


---
## Dynamic clamp

  Dynamic clamp takes membrane voltage, and simulates current that
  will pass through a particular channel; that channel is injected
  real-time, as if that channel existed on the neuron.

  This allows us to use biology to worry about all the other
  conductances, rather than a modeller using poor estimates of the
  conductances.


---
## Dynamic clamp application


  Can two mutually inhibitory neurons fire in synchrony?

  Use dynamic clamp to *virtually* connect two neurons.

Regularity index (RI) = mean (nearest-neighbour dist) / sd (nearest-neighbour dist)

  <!-- \begin{align*} -->
  <!-- \text{regularity index (RI)} \quad  -->
  <!-- &=  -->
  <!-- \frac{\text{mean NND}}{\text{s.d. NND} } -->
  <!-- \qquad \text{RI} > \sqrt{\pi/(4-\pi)} -->
  <!-- \Rightarrow \text{non-random} -->
  <!-- \\ -->
  <!-- \lambda K(t) &= -->
  <!-- \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j \neq i} I( || \vx_i - \vx_j  || \leq t)  -->
  <!-- \qquad -->

## Development of RGCs (Wong and Ghosh 2002)

Possible mechanisms underlying development:

* Competition among neighbours (Perry)

* Cell death (Chalupa)

* Some other combination? 

---
## Model of Delta Notch signalling


* High levels of Delta (ligand) in one cell induce higher Notch
  (receptor) activation in its neighbours, decreasing Delta
  expression in these cells (Collier et al. 1996).

## Cell death
  

  * 20% cell death in alpha RGCs postnatally; mosaic changes
    from random to regular during that period.
    
  * Cell death removes cells that are too close to each other. 
    
`r im1("jeyarasasingam1998_fig5.png",width=600)`
`r pbr("(Jeyarasasingam et al., 1998)")`
   
  * Approach: build model, deleting cells that are too close to
    each other.  Test effect of deleting up to 40% of cells.

---
## Functional independence
  
  * Maybe there is no functional dependence between the on- and
    off-centre arrays. 

  * What happens if we simulate the two arrays independently, just
    preventing somal overlap? 

  * Approach: extend exclusion zone model to bivariate case.

  * Justifiable on the grounds that mechanistic models support the
    phenomenological dmin model.

## Conclusions

* "All models are wrong, but some are useful" (Box)

* Hodgkin-Huxley: allows us to be precise *mechanistically*, but demanding.

* Izhikevich: allows us to capture *phenomenology* and is efficient.

* Retinal mosaics: models have shown the sufficiency of local
  exclusion zones among cells of same type.

* Interactions between cells type are predicted to be rare.
